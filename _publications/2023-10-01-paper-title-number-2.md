title: "Smoothed GMM for Spatial Quantile Regression Model"
permalink: /publication/2023-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'Considering of the cross-sectional dependence, heterogeneity and the possible outliers, this article apply spatial autoregressive model based on the quantile regression, these are the advantages: (1) able to show overall properties of the conditional distribution, (2) able to describe spatial effect at different quantile points; (3) more robust so that could be adapted to more general structure of spatial errors. According to endogeneity due to the spatial lag and differentiability of the objective function, this article selects instrument variables to handle the issue of endogeneity, establishes smoothed moment condition in order to make the objective function differentiable, then chooses the optimal bandwidth to estimate the parameter. Through mathematical proof, large sample properties of consistency, asymptotic normality and validity to the estimators are explicitly shown. By generating data, this method exhibits faster speed great performance in finite sample. At last, this article applys this method into the research of foreign trade agglomeration based on the previous study.'

Considering of the cross-sectional dependence, heterogeneity and the possible outliers, this article apply spatial autoregressive model based on the quantile regression, these are the advantages: (1) able to show overall properties of the conditional distribution, (2) able to describe spatial effect at different quantile points; (3) more robust so that could be adapted to more general structure of spatial errors. According to endogeneity due to the spatial lag and differentiability of the objective function, this article selects instrument variables to handle the issue of endogeneity, establishes smoothed moment condition in order to make the objective function differentiable, then chooses the optimal bandwidth to estimate the parameter. Through mathematical proof, large sample properties of consistency, asymptotic normality and validity to the estimators are explicitly shown.

At last, this article applys this method into the research of foreign trade agglomeration based on the previous study.
