excerpt: 'In consideration of cross-sectional dependence, heterogeneity, and potential outliers, we employ a spatial autoregressive model utilizing quantile regression. The methodology offers several advantages: Comprehensive Representation: It has the capability to unveil overall properties of the conditional distribution. Quantitative Spatial Insight: The model excels in describing spatial effects across various quantile levels. Enhanced Robustness: Its increased robustness enables adaptation to a broader spectrum of spatial error structures. To address endogeneity arising from the spatial lag and the differentiability of the objective function, instrumental variables are employed in this paper. A smoothed moment condition is established to render the objective function differentiable. Furthermore, an optimal bandwidth is selected to estimate the parameter. We explicitly demonstrate the large sample properties of consistency, asymptotic normality, and efficiency for the estimators. Our proposed method exhibits superior speed and performance in finite sample scenarios, as demonstrated through simulation research. Finally, leveraging the spatial quantile regression model, we delve into the heterogeneity and spatial aggregation effects of rural labor transfer on the incidence of rural poverty.'
