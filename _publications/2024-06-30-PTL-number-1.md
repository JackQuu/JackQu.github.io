collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-06-30-PTL-number-1
excerpt: 'This article considers framework of linear regression with high-dimensional confounding, implementing Partial Transfer Learning (PTL) method for source detection, parameter estimation and response prediction through either homogeneous or heterogeneous source transferring. Consistency, asymptotic normality and enhanced efficiency are derived for estimation issue, prediction precision is also generally demonstrated. Simulations showcase the detection efficiency and the superior performance of PTL estimators. Empirical research underscores the practical applicability of PTL, particularly in the realm of biological data analysis.'
