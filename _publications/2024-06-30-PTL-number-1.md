title: "Partial Transfer Learning Under High-Dimensional Confounding: Estimation, Prediction, and Efficiency"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-06-30-PTL-number-1
excerpt: 'Knowledge transfer is of great importance as it implements the target referable information that would ultimately enhance model performance. To this end, I propose a learning framework based on partial transferring of parameters. The setting is under linear regression with high-dimensional confounding, where algorithms for source detection, parameter estimation and response prediction through either homogeneous or heterogeneous sources are designed. The Partial Transfer Learning (PTL) methodology utilizes Double/Debiased Machine Learning, oracle penalty such as SCAD and cross-fitting technique, whose estimation is demonstrated consistent and asymptotically normal. Further more, I present that PTL owns enhanced efficiency for tasks of estimation and prediction. Simulations showcase the detection efficiency and the superior performance of PTL estimators. Empirical research underscores the practical applicability of PTL, particularly in the realm of biological data analysis.'
