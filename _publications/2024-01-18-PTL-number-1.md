collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-01-18-PTL-number-1
excerpt: 'I study a transfer learning problem that aims to partially transfer referable knowledge from informative sources, which operates within a linear setting under high-dimensional confounding factors. I propose a sequence of algorithms for detection, parameter estimation and response prediction through either homogeneous or heterogeneous sources, combined as the Partial Transfer Learning (PTL) methodology. I show that PTL owns detection consistency for transferable sources and its estimation and prediction are demonstrated consistent and asymptotically normal. Further more, I present that PTL owns enhanced e ciency under non-zero signal of linear confounding in both estimation and prediction tasks. Numerical experiments on synthetic and biological datasets showcase the e cacy and robustness of PTL.'
