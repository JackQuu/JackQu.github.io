excerpt: 'I study a transfer learning problem with adaptive $l_1$ penalization for dissimilarity between target and source parameters. Through zero-consistent data-driven guidance, the learning algorithms are free of detection for transferable sources and own doubly robust minimax convergence rate for arbitrary sources compared with Oracle Trans-Lasso (Li et al., 2022). Numerical experiments also show the computational efficiency and robustness of Guided Transfer Learning (GTL) for negative masses.'

I study a transfer learning problem with adaptive $l_1$ penalization for dissimilarity between target and source parameters. Through zero-consistent data-driven guidance, the learning algorithms are free of detection for transferable sources and own doubly robust minimax convergence rate for arbitrary sources compared with Oracle Trans-Lasso (Li et al., 2022). Numerical experiments also show the computational efficiency and robustness of Guided Transfer Learning (GTL) for negative masses.
