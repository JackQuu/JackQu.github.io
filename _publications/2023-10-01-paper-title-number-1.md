excerpt: 'Through quantile regression, fruitions are brought to spatial models as under the background of which, the conditional distribution of the response could be seen panoramically as well as the distinctive spatial effect at different quantile points, the whole process of modeling owns the benefit of robustness. As it is neither convex nor smoothed in loss function of the quantile, '
