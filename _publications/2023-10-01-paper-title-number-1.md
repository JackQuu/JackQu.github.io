excerpt: 'Through quantile regression, fruitions are brought to spatial models as under the background of which, the conditional distribution of the response could be seen panoramically as well as the distinctive spatial effect at different quantile points, the whole process of modeling owns the benefit of robustness. As it's neither convex nor smoothed in loss function of the quantile, this article applies the approach of Inverse Quantile Regression'

This article considers framework of linear regression with high-dimensional confounding, implementing Partial Transfer Learning (PTL) method for source detection and causal/structural parameters’ estimation issue through either homogeneous or heterogeneous source transferring, asymptotics is derived and simulation reveals detection efficiency and the enhanced performance of PTL estimators. Empirical research also demonstrates PTL’s well-application particularly in biological data.
