I'm a third year postgraduate student from [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://stats.xmu.edu.cn/), [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/main.htm). My research interest includes High-Dimensional Data Analysis, Statistical Machine Learning and Causal Inference.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Wei Zhong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=TZE0kMAAAAAJ).

You can find my CV here: [JackQu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
