I'm a third year undergraduate student from [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Xiamen University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Wei Zhong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=TZE0kMAAAAAJ) .

You can find my CV here: [JackQu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
