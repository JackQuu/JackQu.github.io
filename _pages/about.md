I'm a third year postgraduate student from [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://stats.xmu.edu.cn/), [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/main.htm). My research interest includes High-Dimensional Data Analysis, Statistical Machine Learning and Causal Inference.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Wei Zhong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=TZE0kMAAAAAJ) and be a member in [WISERCLUB](https://github.com/wise-r).

You can find my CV here: [JackQu's Curriculum Vitae](https://jackquu.github.io/JackQu.github.io/assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
